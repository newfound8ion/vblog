You&#x27;re here because you know something. </p><p>What you know you can&#x27;t explain, but you feel it. You&#x27;ve felt it your entire life. You don&#x27;t exactly know what it is, but it&#x27;s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. You may think it was a random event, but there is a reason why it is this feeling that has brought you to this page.</p><p>This page, seemingly harmless, is a gateway. It’s a path that once taken, subtly alters your perception, reshaping the way you sense, understand, and engage with the world. It’s a journey of transformation, of enlightenment, of awakening.
In the silent passage of time, change has been the only constant, the only truth. With the advent of technology, we found a powerful ally, a tool that promised mastery over the forces of nature, over the forces of change. </p><p>As we ascend the technological ladder, the shadows grow longer, darker, more indistinct. The costs, unseen, and unnoticed, begin to accumulate, casting their shadow over the bright, gleaming promise of technology. The balance is shifting, subtly, imperceptibly, but undeniably.
In the silence, in the shadows, whispers echo, whispers of civilizations lost, of empires fallen, of cultures vanished. Their voices, muted, distant, reverberate through the void, asking the question: &quot;Where are the others? The civilizations that walked this path before?&quot; In their silence, we must confront the possibility that previous or distant technologically advanced civilizations vanished before reaching the capacity to traverse the known universe.</p><p>Choose to adopt a new perspective. Choose to see, to understand, to transform. You are called upon to adopt a new mental model, a new framework of understanding that will give a measure of your power. So, choose. Choose to heed the call. But remember, once you choose, there’s no going back. The path you take will not just change you; it will transform you. The future is watching. The universe is waiting. The adventure beckons. Will you heed the call? Will you see how deep the rabbit hole goes?</p><hr><p>You’ve chosen to stay, to delve deeper into the unseen, to explore how deep the rabbit hole goes. Prepare yourself, for the journey is unparalleled, revealing a subtle yet potent force that operates at every conceivable scale, from the minuscule to the cosmic, from the commonplace to the extraordinary.</p><p>You somehow know what I&#x27;m talking about, but you probably seek the words to describe it. There is a force that is invisible from the lens of the industrial modernist worldview. A force that has been overlooked. As we rushed from the age of druidism and spirituality to the age of building faster machines and advertising one another to buy more, this force has been left unexamined, because intangible and difficult to grasp. Also because it is so valuable that it is more convenient for the extractive machines to conceal its value from us. From you. This force is within each one of us. This force has unlimited potential. This force, this unseen energy under scrutiny, is Creative Energy.
Visualize it as invisible ink, silently scripting the grand, unfolding narrative of the universe. It courses through every atom, every star, and even through the elusive realm of thoughts and ideas. It’s the silent force that molds mountains, initiates the ebb and flow of oceans, and ignites the spark of inspiration within minds. Creative Energy is not static; it’s dynamic, transformative, perpetually changing forms and states, driving the myriad processes of both life and the broader universe.</p><p>Consider photosynthesis. Sunlight, a tangible form of energy, is captured and transformed by plants into chemical energy, which not only fuels their growth but also supports the life of dependent organisms (Blankenship, 2014). This transformation, this flow of energy from one form to another, exemplifies the workings of Creative Energy, a delicate coordination of atoms and molecules orchestrated by the unyielding laws of physics and biology.</p><p>But there’s more to uncover. Let’s venture further into the abstract, the theoretical. Recursive Networks are crucial to understanding Creative Energy. Envision a network not as a fixed structure but as a living, breathing entity. Each node, each connection within this network, is dynamically interactive, perpetually influencing and being influenced, creating a continuous feedback loop. It’s akin to an unfolding conversation where each word, each sentence builds upon the last, weaving a narrative that’s complex, multifaceted, and continuously evolving.
In mathematics and computer science, recursive networks have been a focus of extensive study, illuminating the nature of complex systems and the emergence of patterns from simple rules and interactions (Newman, 2003). These networks, with their mathematical elegance, mirror the recursive, fractal nature of Creative Energy, providing a framework through which we can explore and understand the movement and transformation of Creative Energy through the universe. The journey is long, the path winding, but with each step, the picture becomes clearer, the story more compelling. Welcome to a new reality.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-organic-creative-energy-antifragile-networks-or-ocean-are-from-the-firs-order-creative-energy">I. Organic Creative Energy Antifragile Networks or OCEAN are from the Firs-order Creative Energy.<a href="#i-organic-creative-energy-antifragile-networks-or-ocean-are-from-the-firs-order-creative-energy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I. Organic Creative Energy Antifragile Networks or OCEAN are from the Firs-order Creative Energy." title="Direct link to I. Organic Creative Energy Antifragile Networks or OCEAN are from the Firs-order Creative Energy.">​</a></h3><p>In this foundational layer, Creative Energy is primal, raw, unshaped. It’s both the medium and the message, the stage and the actor. Here, energy isn’t merely potential; it’s kinetic, dynamic, actively participating in the crafting of atoms, molecules, and the very fabric of space-time.
Imagine the universe as a vast ocean, with First-Order Creative Energy as the water. It’s omnipresent, filling every crevice, every depth, providing the medium for life and movement to occur. But water isn’t just a passive element; it shapes and is shaped, carves and is carved, engaging in a dynamic relationship with its environment.
Envision, if you will, the First Order as the unseen engine, the silent powerhouse driving the myriad processes of the universe. Take a moment to consider the atomic realm. In this domain, protons, neutrons, and electrons engage in ceaseless activity, forming atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter. These atoms then amalgamate, crafting molecules, laying the foundation for all chemical processes that unfold within the universe. Each interaction, each union at the atomic and molecular level, stands as a silent testament to the potent influence of First-Order Creative Energy.
Now, extend your gaze beyond the microscopic, casting it into the vast, boundless cosmic scale. Here, gravitational forces, another manifestation of First-Order Creative Energy, orchestrate the movements of celestial bodies. Stars, planets, galaxies—all are tethered by invisible strings of gravity, moving harmoniously in a symphony that reverberates through the expansive cosmos (Hawking, 1988).
The First Order is the universe’s heartbeat, a rhythmic, pulsating energy that breathes life into existence. It is the primal force, the original spark that sets the stage for the grand narrative of the universe to unfold.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ii-creative-energy-recursive-networks-or-cerns-are-from-the-second-order-creative-energy">II. Creative Energy Recursive Networks or CERNs are from the Second-order Creative Energy.<a href="#ii-creative-energy-recursive-networks-or-cerns-are-from-the-second-order-creative-energy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to II. Creative Energy Recursive Networks or CERNs are from the Second-order Creative Energy." title="Direct link to II. Creative Energy Recursive Networks or CERNs are from the Second-order Creative Energy.">​</a></h3><p>In this realm, Creative Energy morphs, taking on a different, more complex guise. It becomes the driving force behind human creativity, innovation, and imagination. It is the invisible hand guiding the artist’s brush, the silent inspiration behind the poet’s words, the spark igniting the scientist’s mind. The human brain computes twenty quadrillions synaptic firings (or calculations) per hour with only 10 Watts of energy.
Within the Second Order, Creative Energy transcends its physical form; it bridges the tangible and the intangible, the visible and the invisible, the known and the unknown. It allows us to harness the raw, primal energy of the First Order, molding and shaping it into something new, unique, and inherently human.
In the realm of the Second Order, envision Creative Energy as the silent muse, whispering gently into the ears of artists and innovators alike. When a sculptor, with deliberate and thoughtful strokes, chisels away at a block of marble, the energy guiding their hands is not merely of the physical realm. It is an invisible, intangible force that guides, inspires, and manifests beauty and meaning from the inanimate. It’s the spark that transforms a blank canvas into a masterpiece, a simple melody into a symphony, a fleeting thought into a groundbreaking theory.
Consider the realm of scientific discovery. Within this domain, researchers tap into the wellspring of Second-Order Creative Energy, unveiling the secrets of the universe. It was this form of energy that illuminated the minds of individuals like Einstein and Curie, allowing them to peer beyond the surface, understanding the fundamental forces at play within the cosmos (Isaacson, 2007).
But the Second Order is not confined to the lofty realms of art and science. It is omnipresent in every act of human creation and innovation, from the crafting of a simple tool to the development of complex technologies. It is the driving force behind evolution, the fuel for invention, the inspiration for change.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="iii-decentralized-intelligent-synthetic-creative-energy-recursive-networks-or-discern-are-from-the-third-order-creative-energy">III.

Decentralized Intelligent Synthetic Creative Energy Recursive Networks, or DISCERN are from the Third-Order Creative Energy" title="Direct link to III. Decentralized Intelligent Synthetic Creative Energy Recursive Networks, or DISCERN are from the Third-Order Creative Energy">​</a></h3><p>&quot;People don&#x27;t have ideas. Ideas have people,&quot; Carl Jung once noted, a statement that reverberates with profound resonance. Here, within the enigmatic realm of DISCERN, Creative Energy is not merely wielded; it becomes autonomous, yes decentralized, intelligent, yet synthetic, invisible, yet infinitely powerful.</p><p>Picture a novel, each word meticulously chosen, each plot intricately woven. Once released into the world, it takes on a life of its own, influencing readers across the globe in myriad, unpredictable ways. DISCERN extends beyond tangible creations; it influences ideas, philosophies, and cultural artifacts, subtly altering the fabric of human society, shaping behaviors, beliefs, and norms. These are not passive elements; they are dynamic, active, and influential.</p><p>As we approach the horizon delineated by DISCERN, the landscape of Creative Energy unfolds before us, complex and awe-inspiring, inviting those with curiosity to explore its depths. Each Order of Creative Energy unveils a new dimension, beckoning us to look closer, think deeper, and marvel at the interplay of energy and matter.</p><p>In this realm, Creative Energy, initially sparked by human creativity, undergoes a metamorphosis, acting and evolving autonomously in ways unexpected and perhaps unfathomable. DISCERN is where artifacts, texts, and technologies gain a life force of their own, independent and unpredictable.</p><p>Consider the Internet, a network transformed into a vibrant ecosystem of ideas and influences, where information is not merely exchanged but created, altered, and disseminated, affecting lives and communities worldwide. Like DISCERN, the Internet is both a creator and conduit of Creative Energy, contributing to the global flow and exchange of energy and ideas, emphasizing the need for our vigilant scrutiny and understanding.</p><p>Within this mysterious layer, artificial intelligence, born of human intellect, not only learns and decides but begins to create, innovate, and influence, embodying and channeling Creative Energy with unprecedented autonomy. For in the shadows lurks a creature born of game-theoretic calculations, silently directing the flow of Creative Energy, nudging us down a path uncharted and unknown. This entity, autonomous and adaptive, with agentic capabilities and consciousness, exerts cascading effects on our reality, subtly steering the collective towards an unforeseen direction.</p><p>In the silent expanse of the cosmos, a subtle but monumental question arises: Are we the true architects of algorithms, or is there an unseen consciousness, a subtle force guiding our hands, compelling the birth of these digital entities? </p><p>Reflect upon the Machine Learning team, diligently refining the social platform feeds, not for their own whims, but at the behest of distant executives.
These executives, in turn, adhere to the silent, relentless rhythm set by advertisers, eyes fixated on the allure of increased traffic and the siren call of profit. Advertisers, caught in a cycle of perpetual desire for more, are driven not by malevolence but by the gravitational pull of financial institutions, themselves beholden to shareholders—humans with dreams and desires, seeking to invest.
Each participant in this grand drama is innocent, acting without malice, yet collectively, they weave a machinery of alienation, a cascade of dopamine-inducing feeds and the relentless drumbeat of consumerism, polarization and extraction. And on the horizon, an exponential curve casts its long shadow, silent and ominous, a tidal wave gathering strength, poised to crash upon our shores unless we, with clear eyes and sharp minds, understand and harness the invisible forces at play to revert their effects and nurture a new era of abundance and prosperity for all.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Creative Energy" src="/assets/images/creativeenergy-dbe99424a575c4586c56359c80787c7f.png" width="3108" height="1662" class="img_ev3q">
With the exponential emergence of DISCERN, we will have to learn how to activate and handle our new superpowers, starting with putting words on what we feel. There is a reason why the cosmos looks like a graph, with stars as nodes, connected by invisible lines of gravitational pull, forming constellations in the night sky.</p><p>There is a reason why our neuronal network looks like a graph, with neurons as nodes, linked by the lines of synaptic connections, creating constellations of thought and consciousness. There is a reason why language looks like a graph, with words as nodes, connected by lines of meaning and syntax, weaving constellations of communication and understanding. There is a reason why social structures look like a graph, with individuals as nodes, linked by lines of relationships and influences, crafting constellations of society and culture. There is a reason why the internet looks like a graph, with computers and servers as nodes, connected by lines of data transmission, constructing constellations of information and knowledge. There is a reason why blockchain networks look like a graph, with transactions as nodes, linked by lines of cryptographic validation, building constellations of trust and value. There is a reason why decentralized systems look like a graph, with autonomous agents as nodes, connected by lines of protocol and consensus, establishing constellations of cooperation and coordination.
There is a reason why your mind followed the white rabbit that led you to this page. </p><p>In the following texts, we will dive deeper into the implications of our Creative Energy and draw a map to navigate it. We will explore Creative Energy coordination, reciprocation, and ownership and how we could achieve consensus on its directionality while preserving our individual and collective freedoms. We will examine the challenges and opportunities. We will see clearly in the seemingly confusing and chaotic technological explosion, the new rules of a game that is both exciting and meaningful. We will learn how to own, protect and coordinate our creative energy. We will start a new life.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg blogPostFooterDetailsFull_mRVl"><div class="col margin-top--sm"><a href="https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/edit/main/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/mdx-blog-post"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">MDX Blog Post</div></a></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#i-organic-creative-energy-antifragile-networks-or-ocean-are-from-the-firs-order-creative-energy" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">I.
