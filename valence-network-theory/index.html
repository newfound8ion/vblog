A force so integral that it&#x27;s embedded in the essence of life itself, yet so subtle that most of us have never paused to recognize it? What we are about to uncover today is the concept of valence networks. If creative energy is the telos that defines our reality, valence is the language it uses to coordinate. Valence is the language of sentience, the language of social consensus, culture and sense-making.</p><p>Valence is not a term one encounters daily, yet its influence pervades every aspect of existence. It is the invisible metric behind everything—from the primal choices that keep us safe, to the algorithms that decide what we see on our screens. Valence is the hidden network that binds it all, the unseen arbiter that shapes the fabric of decision-making and emergent behavior across complex systems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="valence-the-unifying-substrate-of-adaptive-systems">Valence: The Unifying Substrate of Adaptive Systems<a href="#valence-the-unifying-substrate-of-adaptive-systems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Valence: The Unifying Substrate of Adaptive Systems" title="Direct link to Valence: The Unifying Substrate of Adaptive Systems">​</a></h2><p>Imagine scrolling through your social media feed. What makes you pause on one post while swiftly bypassing another? This seemingly trivial choice is driven by valence. In that split second, your brain assesses each piece of content, assigning a value—positive or negative. A cute puppy video? Positive valence. An angry rant? Negative valence.</p><p>But what exactly is valence? At its core, valence is the positive or negative impact of an interaction. It is the instinctual push or pull, the gut feeling that tells you whether something is good or bad, beneficial or harmful. It is the force that shapes learning and adaptation across all intelligent systems, biological, social, or artificial.</p><p>Valence exists in the euphoric highs of social connection, the aggregated scores of product ratings, the upvotes and likes that pervade our digital world. It is valence that guides us, consciously and subconsciously, towards decisions that enhance well-being or reduce discomfort.</p><p>In biological systems, valence manifests in the form of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin—neural signals that encode reward and punishment, guiding behavior and shaping adaptive learning. Even within the immune system, valence dynamics govern how antibodies identify and neutralize threats, facilitating biological resilience.</p><p>Socially, valence emerges in reputation systems, voting mechanisms, and economic exchange. Social capital, prestige, and influence—whether determined through altruistic contributions or by quantifiable metrics like follower counts—are reflections of valence amplified at scale.</p><p>In artificial systems, valence is ubiquitous yet concealed beneath layers of abstraction. Search engines use engagement signals to rank content. Marketplaces analyze reviews to refine recommendations. Social media algorithms mine interactions for insights into what holds our fleeting attention.</p><p>For machine learning, valence is intrinsic. It is the signal that drives backpropagation in neural networks, the reward function in reinforcement learning. The leap from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, made possible through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), embodies valence-driven optimization—a testament to the profound role of valence in fostering emergent intelligence.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="cybernetic-foundations-valence-as-a-feedback-architect">Cybernetic Foundations: Valence as a Feedback Architect<a href="#cybernetic-foundations-valence-as-a-feedback-architect" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cybernetic Foundations: Valence as a Feedback Architect" title="Direct link to Cybernetic Foundations: Valence as a Feedback Architect">​</a></h2><p>Valence is foundational to cybernetics—the theory of systems, control, and communication. In cybernetic systems, adaptation arises from feedback loops: signals that trigger adjustments, corrections that guide evolution. The principle of requisite variety tells us that for a system to effectively adapt to its environment, it must match the complexity it encounters. Valence, as a universal feedback framework, endows systems with the capacity to mirror and navigate dynamic environments.</p><p>Imagine you&#x27;re walking down a dark alley and suddenly hear footsteps behind you. Instantly, your amygdala assigns a negative valence to the situation, triggering a cascade of neurochemical reactions that prepare you for fight or flight. This is valence at work, shaping your response in real-time. Conversely, think of the joy of biting into your favorite food—a surge of positive valence reinforces that behavior, guiding you towards repeating it.</p><p>Recognizing valence as the currency of intelligence opens the door to profound implications: an overarching framework that standardizes feedback across different domains could weave together isolated silos into a cohesive tapestry of collective insight. Imagine a unified substrate where the valence from human emotions, economic trends, social signals, and machine evaluations coalesces, fostering an intricate network of adaptive learning.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="breaking-down-silos-valence-as-the-open-standard">Breaking Down Silos: Valence as the Open Standard<a href="#breaking-down-silos-valence-as-the-open-standard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Breaking Down Silos: Valence as the Open Standard" title="Direct link to Breaking Down Silos: Valence as the Open Standard">​</a></h2><p>The race towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has, until now, been mired by a closed approach—Web2 infrastructure where data is hoarded, valence signals are monetized, and proprietary models thrive in isolation. This outdated paradigm generates epistemic waste, as each entity&#x27;s valence signals remain siloed, inaccessible to the broader ecosystem.</p><p>Open-source developers, though numerous, lack a unified mechanism to harness valence collaboratively. Once a model is released, its ability to evolve often halts. By establishing a valence protocol—a common language for capturing and sharing feedback—we can create an interoperable intelligence pipeline, allowing millions of models to evolve as one, fueled by a collective substrate of insights.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ipsp-immutable-points-standard-protocol">IPSP: Immutable Points Standard Protocol<a href="#ipsp-immutable-points-standard-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IPSP: Immutable Points Standard Protocol" title="Direct link to IPSP: Immutable Points Standard Protocol">​</a></h2><p>The Immutable Points Standard Protocol (IPSP) is designed to unlock this latent potential. It offers an architecture for capturing, transmitting, and integrating valence signals across both human and machine intelligences. IPSP transforms valence into a shared, agent-centric graph—a framework that is as modular as it is adaptive. By coordinating parameters, feedback, and values across diverse systems, it fosters a more efficient flow of information, reducing redundancy and enabling exponential collective growth.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-principles-of-ipsp">Key principles of IPSP:<a href="#key-principles-of-ipsp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key principles of IPSP:" title="Direct link to Key principles of IPSP:">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>Trust and Provenance: Ensuring verifiable lineage through cryptographic assurance.</p></li><li><p>User-Centric Governance: Aligning feedback and governance with human values, distributed from the origin of data.</p></li><li><p>Transparency and Interoperability: Facilitating open exchange and integrity across systems.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ipsp-operates-on-multiple-levels">IPSP operates on multiple levels:<a href="#ipsp-operates-on-multiple-levels" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IPSP operates on multiple levels:" title="Direct link to IPSP operates on multiple levels:">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>Identity: Valence captured through reputation and reliability metrics.</p></li><li><p>Output: Valence as expressed in feedback on specific contributions.</p></li><li><p>Computation: Sharing internal states of models to improve collective inference.</p></li></ul><p>By capturing valence signals at these levels, IPSP lays the groundwork for an interconnected web of adaptive agents—an emergent network where feedback no longer terminates in isolation, but rather loops into a continuum of shared progress.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-effects-of-the-open-cybernetic-web">Network Effects of the Open Cybernetic Web<a href="#network-effects-of-the-open-cybernetic-web" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Network Effects of the Open Cybernetic Web" title="Direct link to Network Effects of the Open Cybernetic Web">​</a></h2><p>Imagine an internet powered by valence, where every agent—human or AI—contributes to a shared reservoir of value dynamics. Each new agent that joins adds to the network&#x27;s complexity, augmenting its ability to learn, adapt, and self-organize. This is the vision of the New Internet driven by the IPSP, where network effects create a flywheel of accelerated intelligence growth.</p><p>At the heart of this dynamic lies valence—a universal metric for capturing human values, preferences, and aspirations, aligning artificial behaviors with human intent. This convergence forms a unified architecture for collaboration, continuously driving down system entropy while amplifying self-organizing potential.</p><p>Picture a world where every social interaction influences not just your digital presence, but also your impact on computational systems across domains. Valence becomes the bridge between individual actions and collective outcomes—enabling an unprecedented level of coordination and shared advancement.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-call-to-build-the-valence-synergy">A Call to Build the Valence Synergy<a href="#a-call-to-build-the-valence-synergy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Call to Build the Valence Synergy" title="Direct link to A Call to Build the Valence Synergy">​</a></h2><p>This essay is more than a conceptual exploration—it is an invitation. We stand at the threshold of a new era where valence unites human and artificial intelligence. By embracing valence as the currency of intelligence, we can unlock a new frontier of distributed learning and adaptive synergy.</p><p>To those who see beyond the horizon—builders, thinkers, and visionaries—the New Internet beckons. Let us build a reality where feedback is the engine of growth, where alignment spurs collaboration, and where valence catalyzes a digital renaissance. The future is unwritten, but together, we can script a future powered by the synergy of collective intelligence—one in which valence guides us towards our highest potential.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg blogPostFooterDetailsFull_mRVl"><div class="col margin-top--sm"><a href="https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/edit/main/blog/2034-04-07-valence-network-theory.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/defining-creative-energy"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Defining Creative Energy</div></a></nav></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#the-invisible-hand-shaping-intelligence" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The Invisible Hand Shaping Intelligence</a></li><li><a href="#valence-the-unifying-substrate-of-adaptive-systems" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Valence: The Unifying Substrate of Adaptive Systems</a></li><li><a href="#cybernetic-foundations-valence-as-a-feedback-architect" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Cybernetic Foundations: Valence as a Feedback Architect</a></li><li><a href="#breaking-down-silos-valence-as-the-open-standard" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Breaking Down Silos: Valence as the Open Standard</a></li><li><a href="#ipsp-immutable-points-standard-protocol" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">IPSP: Immutable Points Standard Protocol</a><ul><li><a href="#key-principles-of-ipsp" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Key principles of IPSP:</a></li><li><a href="#ipsp-operates-on-multiple-levels" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">IPSP operates on multiple levels:</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#network-effects-of-the-open-cybernetic-web" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Network Effects of the Open Cybernetic Web</a></li><li><a href="#a-call-to-build-the-valence-synergy" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">A Call to Build the Valence Synergy</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Vector Newman.</div></div></div></footer></div>
