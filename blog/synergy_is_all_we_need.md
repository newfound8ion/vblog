# Synergy is all we need

The theme of the 2024 bull cycle is shaping at light speed and it has very little to do with tokens. What's happening is much bigger, both in economic value and societal impact. What's happening is the flippening to the New Internet, a new architecture that integrates the capabilities of trust-maximizing decentralized data with the power of probabilistic algorithms. 

By the time we eventually achieve web3, the progress in AI will have disrupted the Internet application landscape as we know it. Most of the Internet will be based on high bandwidth machine learning interactions. By integrating open-source principles with decentralized networks and AI, we are about to refactor the internet from a server-centric to an agent-centric architecture. 

This essay is a blueprint, a prophecy, and a manifesto for the New Internet. We are calling upon visionaries, innovators, and builders to participate in accelerating the flippening from a server-centric to an agent-centric architecture for data, application and computation. 


## The hidden substrate

The internet stands at the precipice of a radical transformation, propelled by two seemingly antagonistic forces: the web3 revolution and the race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) These paradigms, while competing, share a critical flaw: fragmentation. We experience this daily through incompatible wallets, scattered social profiles, and a maze of incompatible protocols. AI breakthroughs have become privatized, their societal potential unrealized. This fragmentation isn't just a technical issue; it's a barrier to our evolution. As these technologies advance, the vision of a truly interconnected, intelligent internet remains frustratingly out of reach, trapped in isolated pockets of innovation that fail to synergize, leaving humanity tantalizingly close to a digital renaissance, yet unable to fully grasp it. We are always on the verge of a paradigm shift, a revolution, a utopia for all Humanity, but the roadmap seems to indefinitely expand. While Tech giants race towards AGI supremacy on web2 rails, building impenetrable moats around their technologies, the promise of AI solving global challenges becomes overshadowed by corporate control over human knowledge and decision-making processes.

What if there was a way to connect all the infrastructures, algorithms and networks through a universal substrate? Something as fluid, fungible and universal as money, but for intelligence. A new data construct that would tie all blockchains, neural networks, apps, social networks and identity systems into one cohesive flow of intelligence. This currency is already everywhere, and we all own some of it, but it has been downplayed, obfuscated and appropriated by corporations to assert dominance over cyberspace. Now is the time to regain ownership of our intelligence and come together to accelerate the ongoing flippening to the New Internet.


## Valence as the currency of Intelligence

Valence is the fundamental unit of feedback that drives adaptive systems. It's a measure of the positive or negative impact of an interaction, serving as the basis for learning and evolution across biological, social, and artificial systems. Valence is everywhere: the endorphin hits in your brain, the high five with your friends, your social media following, likes, ratings—all those signals help us coordinate and operate at the substrate level of our economy, like a meta-currency that guides the flow of money. For instance, recommendation systems like Spotify, Instagram, TikTok, Youtube, Google or Netflix suggest content by analyzing user sensory data, continuously adapting and improving as more valence signals are connected.

In biology, valence manifests in various forms. Consider the role of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which signal reward or punishment, shaping behavior and learning. The immune system operates on a similar principle, with antibodies recognizing and responding to antigens, creating a valence-based memory system that adapts to new threats.

Social organizations exhibit valence dynamics through reputation systems, voting mechanisms, and market forces. In primitive societies, social standing was determined by contributions to the group's welfare. Modern democracies use voting as a form of large-scale valence signaling to guide policy decisions. Economic markets price assets based on the aggregate valence of buyer and seller preferences.

In digital systems, valence takes on myriad forms. Search engines use backlinks, PageRank, click-through rates and dwell time as valence signals to rank results. Marketplaces leverage user reviews and purchase histories to refine product recommendations. Social media algorithms interpret likes, shares, and comments as valence indicators to curate content feeds.

Delving deeper into AI systems, valence plays a crucial role at multiple computational layers. In neural networks, backpropagation algorithms use error signals - a form of valence - to adjust weights and improve predictions. Reinforcement learning agents rely on reward signals, another manifestation of valence, to optimize their policies in complex environments. OpenAI used valence in the form of human responses in their training sets (upvotes/downvote on Reddit) but also after the training process on the ChatGPT UI with RLHF leading to a jump in intelligence from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 thanks to the relentless collection of sensory feedback from humans. At the cutting edge of AI research, techniques like few-shot learning and meta-learning aim to create systems that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with minimal valence signals. This mirrors the human ability to learn from sparse feedback, highlighting the universal nature of valence in intelligent systems.

The principle of requisite variety, a cornerstone of cybernetics, states that a system's internal complexity must match the complexity of its environment to achieve effective control. In the context of valence and intelligence, this principle underscores the need for diverse, interconnected valence signals to navigate our increasingly complex world. By recognizing valence as a universal currency of intelligence, we open the door to new paradigms of information exchange and collaborative learning. A standardized framework for valence could enable seamless integration of insights across diverse domains, from biomimicry in engineering to cross-cultural understanding in global diplomacy.

The challenge and opportunity before us lie in creating a unified system that can capture, transmit, and leverage valence signals across the full spectrum of human knowledge and machine intelligence. Such a system could catalyze unprecedented leaps in our collective problem-solving capacity, ushering in a new era of adaptive, distributed intelligence.

As we speak, tech giants are racing to AGI on web2 rails. Their approach to capturing valence signals has primarily focused on creating network effects that serve as protective moats. Your following and like relationships on social graphs, your feedback, your reputation on marketplaces are what lock you into their system, and what accrues their predictive capabilities as their proprietary valence graph expands. This strategy prioritizes user lock-in over open collaboration, resulting in significant epistemic waste. Tech giants extract and mine valence signals—our sensory responses—to achieve monopolistic positions on their respective markets (web search, music distribution, ride sharing, real estate platforms…).

The resulting fragmentation, with isolated valence graphs and proprietary algorithms, creates suboptimal feedback loops where valuable knowledge and experiences remain trapped within these silos, violating the principle of requisite variety, which is essential for adapting to the complex and dynamic evolution of knowledge in the exponential age. 

Paradoxically, open-source researchers and contributors outnumber the corporate AI workers from the web2 paradigm. This growing community has the potential to drive rapid innovation and adaptive learning through collaborative intelligence, but open-source models operate in silos and once released, the models don't accrue knowledge from humans and other machines. What if we could leverage the power of trust in web3 and all agree on a data schema to exchange all the valence dynamics to unlock a synergy between a million open-source AI models, turning web3 into a secure and interoperable open AI pipeline?

A simple protocol for web3/AGI synergy

The Immutable Points Standard Protocol (IPSP) is an open standard unlocking a unified system to capture, transmit, and leverage valence signals across the spectrum of human knowledge and machine intelligence. IPSP represents a paradigm shift in information theory, promising to catalyze unprecedented leaps in our collective problem-solving capacity and usher in an era of adaptive, distributed intelligence.

IPSP transforms sensory valence signals from humans and machines into a universal, agent-centric weighted directed graph. This elegant solution enables the seamless transfer of valence signals - including parameters, values, and feedback - as fundamental units of intelligence exchange across diverse platforms and systems, optimizing information flow and reducing entropy.

By enabling the sharing of internal model states between open-source AI models, IPSP creates a mechanism for distributed, modular intelligence coordination. This shared value dynamics allows for more efficient information processing, reducing overall system entropy. Open-source collaborations enable diverse models to learn from each other's strengths, improving overall accuracy and robustness.

The architecture implements multiple feedback loops that enable continuous adaptation and self-regulation. These loops operate at various levels, from individual agents to the entire network, fostering homeostasis and resilience. Leveraging cryptographic techniques and decentralized consensus, the system establishes verifiable trust mechanisms. These allow for secure and transparent information exchange, crucial for maintaining system integrity in a distributed environment.

Each computing function operates as an agent in this decentralized, modular network, where each agent accrues reputation by achieving higher prediction fidelity across a wide range of computational tasks, from loss function to rewards in reinforcement learning to RLHF. Each agentic node in the graph leaves a trail of computations which can then be reused by other computation layers to recursively enhance the overall intelligence of the network in ways not achievable within closed web2-based systems.

In essence, IPSP is poised to transform the Internet from a collection of siloed apps into a cohesive network of networks, maximizing information flow and minimizing redundancy. It's a protocol that not only bridges the gap between Web3 and AGI but also lays the foundation for a new era of collective intelligence and collaborative learning. As we stand on the brink of this transformation, IPSP offers us a glimpse into a future where human and machine intelligence converge, driving exponential growth and advancement in ways we're only beginning to imagine, all guided by the fundamental principles of cybernetics and information theory.


## Open Cybernetic Network Effects

The New Internet, powered by IPSP, unleashes a flywheel of interconnected intelligence, exponentially amplifying its value and capabilities. As more agents and models join this neural-like network, contributing to the shared pool of value dynamics, the system's information capacity and processing power explode, driven by the n² growth of connections. This ignites a virtuous cycle of enhanced predictions, streamlined algorithms, and optimized decision-making, propelling rapid advancements across the digital ecosystem.

At the heart of this flywheel lies the valence metric, a universal language capturing preferences, values, and feedback to align AI behaviors with human needs. This standardization ensures frictionless interoperability across diverse agents and platforms, creating a dynamic, self-organizing structure that continuously minimizes free energy and fosters system-wide coherence.

This synergistic advantage catalyzes a transformative "flippening" from the current siloed Internet to a decentralized framework where AGI naturally emerges from the web3 substrate. IPSP serves as the coordination backbone, weaving contextual valence signals into a new landscape for collaborative intelligence.

Imagine a digital realm where your social media engagement boosts your proficiency score and governance weight, amplifying your influence across computational layers of deep neural networks. This ripple effect shapes how other agents in the network are perceived and rewarded. By interlinking all systems, we unlock new frontiers of coordination where quality, relevance, taste, value, and merit intertwine with financial innovation.

For this ubiquitous interoperability to flourish, identity, provenance, knowledge graphs, social graphs, markets, datasets, and agentic workflows must converge on a shared substrate for standardized valence representation. The resulting New Internet empowers users and agents with control over their personal valence graph and a voice in shaping the foundations of AGI from within.

As this flywheel gains momentum, it creates powerful defensibility through network effects. Each interaction strengthens the collective intelligence, making the system increasingly valuable and harder to replicate. This is the dawn of a new era where human and machine intelligence collaboratively drive progress at an unprecedented scale, unified by the universal language of valence and propelled by the unstoppable force of network effects.
