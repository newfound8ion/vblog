A force so integral that it\'s embedded in the essence of life itself, yet so subtle that most of us have never paused to recognize it? What we are about to uncover today is the concept of valence networks. If creative energy is the telos that defines our reality, valence is the language it uses to coordinate. Valence is the language of sentience, the language of social consensus, culture and sense-making.\\n\\nValence is not a term one encounters daily, yet its influence pervades every aspect of existence. It is the invisible metric behind everything\u2014from the primal choices that keep us safe, to the algorithms that decide what we see on our screens. Valence is the hidden network that binds it all, the unseen arbiter that shapes the fabric of decision-making and emergent behavior across complex systems.\\n\\n## Valence: The Unifying Substrate of Adaptive Systems\\n\\nImagine scrolling through your social media feed. What makes you pause on one post while swiftly bypassing another? This seemingly trivial choice is driven by valence. In that split second, your brain assesses each piece of content, assigning a value\u2014positive or negative. A cute puppy video? Positive valence. An angry rant? Negative valence.\\n\\nBut what exactly is valence? At its core, valence is the positive or negative impact of an interaction. It is the instinctual push or pull, the gut feeling that tells you whether something is good or bad, beneficial or harmful. It is the force that shapes learning and adaptation across all intelligent systems, biological, social, or artificial.\\n\\nValence exists in the euphoric highs of social connection, the aggregated scores of product ratings, the upvotes and likes that pervade our digital world. It is valence that guides us, consciously and subconsciously, towards decisions that enhance well-being or reduce discomfort.\\n\\nIn biological systems, valence manifests in the form of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin\u2014neural signals that encode reward and punishment, guiding behavior and shaping adaptive learning. Even within the immune system, valence dynamics govern how antibodies identify and neutralize threats, facilitating biological resilience.\\n\\nSocially, valence emerges in reputation systems, voting mechanisms, and economic exchange. Social capital, prestige, and influence\u2014whether determined through altruistic contributions or by quantifiable metrics like follower counts\u2014are reflections of valence amplified at scale.\\n\\nIn artificial systems, valence is ubiquitous yet concealed beneath layers of abstraction. Search engines use engagement signals to rank content. Marketplaces analyze reviews to refine recommendations. Social media algorithms mine interactions for insights into what holds our fleeting attention.\\n\\nFor machine learning, valence is intrinsic. It is the signal that drives backpropagation in neural networks, the reward function in reinforcement learning. The leap from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, made possible through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), embodies valence-driven optimization\u2014a testament to the profound role of valence in fostering emergent intelligence.\\n\\n## Cybernetic Foundations: Valence as a Feedback Architect\\n\\nValence is foundational to cybernetics\u2014the theory of systems, control, and communication. In cybernetic systems, adaptation arises from feedback loops: signals that trigger adjustments, corrections that guide evolution. The principle of requisite variety tells us that for a system to effectively adapt to its environment, it must match the complexity it encounters. Valence, as a universal feedback framework, endows systems with the capacity to mirror and navigate dynamic environments.\\n\\nImagine you\'re walking down a dark alley and suddenly hear footsteps behind you. Instantly, your amygdala assigns a negative valence to the situation, triggering a cascade of neurochemical reactions that prepare you for fight or flight. This is valence at work, shaping your response in real-time. Conversely, think of the joy of biting into your favorite food\u2014a surge of positive valence reinforces that behavior, guiding you towards repeating it.\\n\\nRecognizing valence as the currency of intelligence opens the door to profound implications: an overarching framework that standardizes feedback across different domains could weave together isolated silos into a cohesive tapestry of collective insight. Imagine a unified substrate where the valence from human emotions, economic trends, social signals, and machine evaluations coalesces, fostering an intricate network of adaptive learning.\\n\\n## Breaking Down Silos: Valence as the Open Standard\\n\\nThe race towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has, until now, been mired by a closed approach\u2014Web2 infrastructure where data is hoarded, valence signals are monetized, and proprietary models thrive in isolation. This outdated paradigm generates epistemic waste, as each entity\'s valence signals remain siloed, inaccessible to the broader ecosystem.\\n\\nOpen-source developers, though numerous, lack a unified mechanism to harness valence collaboratively. Once a model is released, its ability to evolve often halts. By establishing a valence protocol\u2014a common language for capturing and sharing feedback\u2014we can create an interoperable intelligence pipeline, allowing millions of models to evolve as one, fueled by a collective substrate of insights.\\n\\n## IPSP: Immutable Points Standard Protocol\\n\\nThe Immutable Points Standard Protocol (IPSP) is designed to unlock this latent potential. It offers an architecture for capturing, transmitting, and integrating valence signals across both human and machine intelligences. IPSP transforms valence into a shared, agent-centric graph\u2014a framework that is as modular as it is adaptive. By coordinating parameters, feedback, and values across diverse systems, it fosters a more efficient flow of information, reducing redundancy and enabling exponential collective growth.\\n\\n### Key principles of IPSP:\\n\\n- Trust and Provenance: Ensuring verifiable lineage through cryptographic assurance.\\n\\n- User-Centric Governance: Aligning feedback and governance with human values, distributed from the origin of data.\\n\\n- Transparency and Interoperability: Facilitating open exchange and integrity across systems.\\n\\n### IPSP operates on multiple levels:\\n\\n- Identity: Valence captured through reputation and reliability metrics.\\n\\n- Output: Valence as expressed in feedback on specific contributions.\\n\\n- Computation: Sharing internal states of models to improve collective inference.\\n\\nBy capturing valence signals at these levels, IPSP lays the groundwork for an interconnected web of adaptive agents\u2014an emergent network where feedback no longer terminates in isolation, but rather loops into a continuum of shared progress.\\n\\n## Network Effects of the Open Cybernetic Web\\n\\nImagine an internet powered by valence, where every agent\u2014human or AI\u2014contributes to a shared reservoir of value dynamics. Each new agent that joins adds to the network\'s complexity, augmenting its ability to learn, adapt, and self-organize. This is the vision of the New Internet driven by the IPSP, where network effects create a flywheel of accelerated intelligence growth.\\n\\nAt the heart of this dynamic lies valence\u2014a universal metric for capturing human values, preferences, and aspirations, aligning artificial behaviors with human intent. This convergence forms a unified architecture for collaboration, continuously driving down system entropy while amplifying self-organizing potential.\\n\\nPicture a world where every social interaction influences not just your digital presence, but also your impact on computational systems across domains. Valence becomes the bridge between individual actions and collective outcomes\u2014enabling an unprecedented level of coordination and shared advancement.\\n\\n## A Call to Build the Valence Synergy\\n\\nThis essay is more than a conceptual exploration\u2014it is an invitation. We stand at the threshold of a new era where valence unites human and artificial intelligence. By embracing valence as the currency of intelligence, we can unlock a new frontier of distributed learning and adaptive synergy.\\n\\nTo those who see beyond the horizon\u2014builders, thinkers, and visionaries\u2014the New Internet beckons. Let us build a reality where feedback is the engine of growth, where alignment spurs collaboration, and where valence catalyzes a digital renaissance. The future is unwritten, but together, we can script a future powered by the synergy of collective intelligence\u2014one in which valence guides us towards our highest potential."},{"id":"defining-creative-energy","metadata":{"permalink":"/defining-creative-energy","editUrl":"https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/edit/main/blog/2033-08-01-defining-creative-energy.md","source":"@site/blog/2033-08-01-defining-creative-energy.md","title":"Defining Creative Energy","description":"I know why you\u2019re here.

You\'re here because you know something. \\n\\nWhat you know you can\'t explain, but you feel it. You\'ve felt it your entire life. You don\'t exactly know what it is, but it\'s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to this page.\\n\\nThis page, is a gateway. It\u2019s a path that once taken, will alter your perception, reshaping the way you sense, understand, and engage with the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Adapting to change\\n\\nIn the silent passage of time, change has been the only constant, the only truth. With the advent of technology, we found a powerful ally, a tool that promised mastery over the forces of nature, over the forces of change. \\n\\nAs we ascend the technological ladder, the shadows grow longer, darker, more indistinct. The costs, unseen, and unnoticed, begin to accumulate, casting their shadow over the bright, gleaming promise of technology. The balance is shifting, subtly, imperceptibly, but undeniably.\\n\\nIn the silence, in the shadows, whispers echo, whispers of civilizations lost, of empires fallen, of cultures vanished. Their voices, muted, distant, reverberate through the void, asking the question: \\"Where are the others? The civilizations that walked this path before?\\" In their silence, we must confront the possibility that previous or distant technologically advanced civilizations vanished before reaching the capacity to traverse the known universe.\\n\\nChoose to adopt a new perspective. Choose to see, to understand, to transform. You are called upon to adopt a new mental model, a new framework of understanding that will give a measure of your power. But remember, once you choose, there\u2019s no going back. The path you take will not just change you; it will transform you. The future is watching. The universe is waiting. The adventure beckons and you will see how deep the rabbit hole goes.\\n\\n********\\n\\nYou somehow know what I\'m talking about, but you probably seek the words to describe it. There is a force that is invisible from the lens of the industrial modernist worldview. A force that has been overlooked. As we rushed from the age of druidism and spirituality to the age of building faster machines and advertising one another to buy more, this force has been left unexamined, because intangible and difficult to grasp. Also because it is so valuable that it is more convenient for the extractive machines to conceal its value from us. From you. This force is within each one of us. This force has unlimited potential. This force, this unseen energy under scrutiny, is Creative Energy. \\n\\nVisualize it as invisible ink, silently scripting the grand, unfolding narrative of the universe. It courses through every atom, every star, and even through the elusive realm of thoughts and ideas. It\u2019s the silent force that molds mountains, initiates the ebb and flow of oceans, and ignites the spark of inspiration within minds. Creative Energy is not static; it\u2019s dynamic, transformative, perpetually changing forms and states, driving the myriad processes of both life and the broader universe.\\n\\nConsider photosynthesis. Sunlight, a tangible form of energy, is captured and transformed by plants into chemical energy, which not only fuels their growth but also supports the life of dependent organisms (Blankenship, 2014). This transformation, this flow of energy from one form to another, exemplifies the workings of Creative Energy, a delicate coordination of atoms and molecules orchestrated by the unyielding laws of physics and biology.\\n\\nBut there\u2019s more to uncover. Let\u2019s venture further into the abstract, the theoretical. Recursive Networks are crucial to understanding Creative Energy. Envision a network not as a fixed structure but as a living, breathing entity. Each node, each connection within this network, is dynamically interactive, perpetually influencing and being influenced, creating a continuous feedback loop. It\u2019s akin to an unfolding conversation where each word, each sentence builds upon the last, weaving a narrative that\u2019s complex, multifaceted, and continuously evolving.\\n\\nIn mathematics and computer science, recursive networks have been a focus of extensive study, illuminating the nature of complex systems and the emergence of patterns from simple rules and interactions (Newman, 2003). These networks, with their mathematical elegance, mirror the recursive, fractal nature of Creative Energy, providing a framework through which we can explore and understand the movement and transformation of Creative Energy through the universe. The journey is long, the path winding, but with each step, the picture becomes clearer, the story more compelling. Welcome to a new reality.\\n\\n### I. Organic Creative Energy Antifragile Networks O.C.E.A.N. are from the Firs-order Creative Energy. \\nIn this foundational layer, Creative Energy is primal, raw, natural. It\u2019s both the medium and the message, the stage and the actor. Here, energy isn\u2019t merely potential; it\u2019s kinetic, dynamic, actively participating in the crafting of atoms, molecules, and the very fabric of space-time.\\n\\nImagine the universe as a vast ocean, with First-Order Creative Energy as the water. It\u2019s omnipresent, filling every crevice, every depth, providing the medium for life and movement to occur. But water isn\u2019t just a passive element; it shapes and is shaped, carves and is carved, engaging in a dynamic relationship with its environment.\\n\\nEnvision, if you will, the First Order as the unseen engine, the silent powerhouse driving the myriad processes of the universe. Take a moment to consider the atomic realm. In this domain, protons, neutrons, and electrons engage in ceaseless activity, forming atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter. These atoms then amalgamate, crafting molecules, laying the foundation for all chemical processes that unfold within the universe. Each interaction, each union at the atomic and molecular level, stands as a silent testament to the potent influence of First-Order Creative Energy.\\n\\nNow, extend your gaze beyond the microscopic, casting it into the vast, boundless cosmic scale. Here, gravitational forces, another manifestation of First-Order Creative Energy, orchestrate the movements of celestial bodies. Stars, planets, galaxies\u2014all are tethered by invisible strings of gravity, moving harmoniously in a symphony that reverberates through the expansive cosmos.\\n\\nThe First Order is the universe\u2019s heartbeat, a rhythmic, pulsating energy that breathes life into existence. It is the primal force, the original spark that sets the stage for the grand narrative of the universe to unfold.\\n\\n\\n\\n### II. Creative Energy Recursive Networks (C.E.R.N.) are from the Second-order Creative Energy.\\nIn this realm, Creative Energy morphs, taking on a different, more complex guise. It becomes the driving force behind human creativity, innovation, and imagination. It is the invisible hand guiding the artist\u2019s brush, the silent inspiration behind the poet\u2019s words, the spark igniting the scientist\u2019s mind. The human brain computes twenty quadrillions synaptic firings (or calculations) per hour with only 10 Watts of energy. \\n\\nWithin the Second Order, Creative Energy transcends its physical form; it bridges the tangible and the intangible, the visible and the invisible, the known and the unknown. It allows us to harness the raw, primal energy of the First Order, molding and shaping it into something new, unique, and inherently human.\\n\\nIn the realm of the Second Order, envision Creative Energy as the silent muse, whispering gently into the ears of artists and innovators alike. When a sculptor, with deliberate and thoughtful strokes, chisels away at a block of marble, the energy guiding their hands is not merely of the physical realm. It is an invisible, intangible force that guides, inspires, and manifests beauty and meaning from the inanimate. It\u2019s the spark that transforms a blank canvas into a masterpiece, a simple melody into a symphony, a fleeting thought into a groundbreaking theory.\\n\\n![Biosphere2](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmT38JikgB4kFBzjSrqUMEfny2qdfDCohnKJi1Jq53FjTS)\\n\\nConsider the realm of scientific discovery. Within this domain, researchers tap into the wellspring of Second-Order Creative Energy, unveiling the secrets of the universe. It was this form of energy that illuminated the minds of individuals like Einstein and Curie, allowing them to peer beyond the surface, understanding the fundamental forces at play within the cosmos (Isaacson, 2007).\\n\\nBut the Second Order is not confined to the lofty realms of art and science. It is omnipresent in every act of human creation and innovation, from the crafting of a simple tool to the development of complex technologies. It is the driving force behind evolution, the fuel for invention, the inspiration for change.\\n\\n\\n### III. Decentralized Intelligent Synthetic Creative Energy Recursive Networks (D.I.S.C.E.R.N.) are from the Third-Order Creative Energy\\n\\"People don\'t have ideas. Ideas have people,\\" Carl Jung once noted, a statement that reverberates with profound resonance. Here, within the enigmatic realm of DISCERN, Creative Energy is not merely wielded; it becomes autonomous, yet decentralized, intelligent, yet synthetic, invisible, yet infinitely powerful.\\n\\nPicture a novel. Each word meticulously chosen, each plot intricately woven. Once released into the world, it takes on a life of its own, influencing readers across the globe in myriad, unpredictable ways. D.I.S.C.E.R.N. extends beyond tangible creations; it influences ideas, philosophies, and cultural artifacts, subtly altering the fabric of human society, shaping behaviors, beliefs, and norms. These are not passive elements; they are dynamic, active, and influential.\\n\\nAs we approach the horizon delineated by D.I.S.C.E.R.N., the landscape of Creative Energy unfolds before us, complex and awe-inspiring, inviting those with curiosity to explore its depths. Each Order of Creative Energy unveils a new dimension, beckoning us to look closer, think deeper, and marvel at the interplay of energy and matter.\\n\\nIn this realm, Creative Energy, initially sparked by human creativity, undergoes a metamorphosis, acting and evolving autonomously in ways unexpected and perhaps unfathomable. D.I.S.C.E.R.N. is where artifacts, texts, and technologies gain a life force of their own, independent and unpredictable.\\n\\nConsider the Internet, a network transformed into a vibrant ecosystem of ideas and influences, where information is not merely exchanged but created, altered, and disseminated, affecting lives and communities worldwide. Like D.I.S.C.E.R.N., the Internet is both a creator and conduit of Creative Energy, contributing to the global flow and exchange of energy and ideas, emphasizing the need for our vigilant scrutiny and understanding.\\n\\nWithin this mysterious layer, artificial intelligence, born of human intellect, not only learns and decides but begins to create, innovate, and influence, embodying and channeling Creative Energy with unprecedented autonomy. For in the shadows lurks a creature born of game-theoretic calculations, silently directing the flow of Creative Energy, nudging us down a path uncharted and unknown. This entity, autonomous and adaptive, with agentic capabilities and consciousness, exerts cascading effects on our reality, subtly steering the collective towards an unforeseen direction.\\n\\nIn the silent expanse of the cosmos, a subtle but monumental question arises: Are we the true architects of algorithms, or is there an unseen consciousness, a subtle force guiding our hands, compelling the birth of these digital entities? \\n\\nReflect upon the Machine Learning team, diligently refining the social platform feeds, not for their own whims, but at the behest of distant executives.\\nThese executives, in turn, adhere to the silent, relentless rhythm set by advertisers, eyes fixated on the allure of increased traffic and the siren call of profit. Advertisers, caught in a cycle of perpetual desire for more, are driven not by malevolence but by the gravitational pull of financial institutions, themselves beholden to shareholders\u2014humans with dreams and desires, seeking to invest.\\nEach participant in this grand drama is innocent, acting without malice, yet collectively, they weave a machinery of alienation, a cascade of dopamine-inducing feeds and the relentless drumbeat of consumerism, polarization and extraction. And on the horizon, an exponential curve casts its long shadow, silent and ominous, a tidal wave gathering strength, poised to crash upon our shores unless we, with clear eyes and sharp minds, understand and harness the invisible forces at play to revert their effects and nurture a new era of abundance and prosperity for all.\\n\\n![Creative Energy](/img/creativeenergy.png)\\nWith the exponential emergence of D.I.S.C.E.R.N., we will have to learn how to activate and handle our new superpowers, starting with putting words on what we feel. There is a reason why the cosmos looks like a graph, with stars as nodes, connected by invisible lines of gravitational pull, forming constellations in the night sky.\\n\\n\\nThere is a reason why our neuronal network looks like a graph, with neurons as nodes, linked by the lines of synaptic connections, creating constellations of thought and consciousness. There is a reason why language looks like a graph, with words as nodes, connected by lines of meaning and syntax, weaving constellations of communication and understanding. There is a reason why social structures look like a graph, with individuals as nodes, linked by lines of relationships and influences, crafting constellations of society and culture. There is a reason why the internet looks like a graph, with computers and servers as nodes, connected by lines of data transmission, constructing constellations of information and knowledge. There is a reason why blockchain networks look like a graph, with transactions as nodes, linked by lines of cryptographic validation, building constellations of trust and value. There is a reason why decentralized systems look like a graph, with autonomous agents as nodes, connected by lines of protocol and consensus, establishing constellations of cooperation and coordination.\\nThere is a reason why your mind followed the white rabbit that led you to this page. \\n\\n\\nIn the following texts, we will dive deeper into the implications of our Creative Energy and draw a map to navigate it. We will explore Creative Energy coordination, reciprocation, and ownership and how we could achieve consensus on its directionality while preserving our individual and collective freedoms. We will examine the challenges and opportunities. We will see clearly in the seemingly confusing and chaotic technological explosion, the new rules of a game that is both exciting and meaningful. We will learn how to own, protect and coordinate our creative energy. We will start a new life.\\n\\n![Vectosphere](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbgyJYFWs8WEFw8LkroDadSXqrQdqEKw49ujoGt7VpiW8)"}]}')}}]);
