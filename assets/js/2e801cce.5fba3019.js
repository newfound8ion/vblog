What\'s happening is much bigger, both in economic value and societal impact. What\'s happening is the flippening to the New Internet, a new architecture that integrates the capabilities of trust-maximizing decentralized data with the power of probabilistic algorithms.  \\n\\nBy the time we eventually achieve web3, the progress in AI will have disrupted the Internet application landscape as we know it. Most of the Internet will be based on high bandwidth machine learning interactions. By integrating open-source principles with decentralized networks and AI, we are about to refactor the internet from a server-centric to an agent-centric architecture. \\n\\nThis essay is a blueprint, a prophecy, and a manifesto for the New Internet. We are calling upon visionaries, innovators, and builders to participate in accelerating the flippening from a server-centric to an agent-centric architecture for data, application and computation. \\n\\n\\n## The hidden substrate\\n\\nThe internet stands at the precipice of a radical transformation, propelled by two seemingly antagonistic forces: the web3 revolution and the race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) These paradigms, while competing, share a critical flaw: fragmentation. We experience this daily through incompatible wallets, scattered social profiles, and a maze of incompatible protocols. AI breakthroughs have become privatized, their societal potential unrealized. This fragmentation isn\'t just a technical issue; it\'s a barrier to our evolution. As these technologies advance, the vision of a truly interconnected, intelligent internet remains frustratingly out of reach, trapped in isolated pockets of innovation that fail to synergize, leaving humanity tantalizingly close to a digital renaissance, yet unable to fully grasp it. We are always on the verge of a paradigm shift, a revolution, a utopia for all Humanity, but the roadmap seems to indefinitely expand. While Tech giants race towards AGI supremacy on web2 rails, building impenetrable moats around their technologies, the promise of AI solving global challenges becomes overshadowed by corporate control over human knowledge and decision-making processes.\\n\\nWhat if there was a way to connect all the infrastructures, algorithms and networks through a universal substrate? Something as fluid, fungible and universal as money, but for intelligence. A new data construct that would tie all blockchains, neural networks, apps, social networks and identity systems into one cohesive flow of intelligence. This currency is already everywhere, and we all own some of it, but it has been downplayed, obfuscated and appropriated by corporations to assert dominance over cyberspace. Now is the time to regain ownership of our intelligence and come together to accelerate the ongoing flippening to the New Internet. But what is this currency? And how does it work?\\n\\n\\n## Valence as the currency of Intelligence\\n\\nValence is the fundamental unit of feedback that drives adaptive systems. It\'s a measure of the positive or negative impact of an interaction, serving as the basis for learning and evolution across biological, social, and artificial systems. Valence is everywhere: the endorphin hits in your brain, the high five with your friends, your social media following, likes, ratings\u2014all those signals help us coordinate and operate at the substrate level of our economy, like a meta-currency that guides the flow of money. For instance, recommendation systems like Spotify, Instagram, TikTok, Youtube, Google or Netflix suggest content by analyzing user sensory data, continuously adapting and improving as more valence signals are connected.\\n\\n![Weighted graph](https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/assets/112469623/68ac4542-9d27-4ca3-928a-9d7ffac1d3ae)\\n\\n\\nIn biology, valence manifests in various forms. Consider the role of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which signal reward or punishment, shaping behavior and learning. The immune system operates on a similar principle, with antibodies recognizing and responding to antigens, creating a valence-based memory system that adapts to new threats.\\n\\nSocial organizations exhibit valence dynamics through reputation systems, voting mechanisms, and market forces. In primitive societies, social standing was determined by contributions to the group\'s welfare. Modern democracies use voting as a form of large-scale valence signaling to guide policy decisions. Economic markets price assets based on the aggregate valence of buyer and seller preferences.\\n\\nIn digital systems, valence takes on myriad forms. Search engines use backlinks, PageRank, click-through rates and dwell time as valence signals to rank results. Marketplaces leverage user reviews and purchase histories to refine product recommendations. Social media algorithms interpret likes, shares, and comments as valence indicators to curate content feeds.\\n\\nDelving deeper into AI systems, valence plays a crucial role at multiple computational layers. In neural networks, backpropagation algorithms use error signals - a form of valence - to adjust weights and improve predictions. Reinforcement learning agents rely on reward signals, another manifestation of valence, to optimize their policies in complex environments. OpenAI used valence in the form of human responses in their training sets (upvotes/downvote on Reddit) but also after the training process on the ChatGPT UI with RLHF leading to a jump in intelligence from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 thanks to the relentless collection of sensory feedback from humans. \\n\\n![RLHF](https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/assets/112469623/d0f07b8b-068e-4775-b101-daa73611cc37)\\n\\n![RLHF](https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/blob/main/static/img/rlhf.png)\\n\\nAt the cutting edge of AI research, techniques like few-shot learning and meta-learning aim to create systems that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with minimal valence signals. This mirrors the human ability to learn from sparse feedback, highlighting the universal nature of valence in intelligent systems.\\n\\nThe principle of requisite variety, a cornerstone of cybernetics, states that a system\'s internal complexity must match the complexity of its environment to achieve effective control. In the context of valence and intelligence, this principle underscores the need for diverse, interconnected valence signals to navigate our increasingly complex world. By recognizing valence as a universal currency of intelligence, we open the door to new paradigms of information exchange and collaborative learning. A standardized framework for valence could enable seamless integration of insights across diverse domains, from biomimicry in engineering to cross-cultural understanding in global diplomacy.\\n\\n![cybernetic](https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/assets/112469623/cc8c8bf4-9f7c-4109-8c75-760a800cc9a9)\\n\\n\\nThe challenge and opportunity before us lie in creating a unified system that can capture, transmit, and leverage valence signals across the full spectrum of human knowledge and machine intelligence. Such a system could catalyze unprecedented leaps in our collective problem-solving capacity, ushering in a new era of adaptive, distributed intelligence.\\n\\nAs we speak, tech giants are racing to AGI on web2 rails. Their approach to capturing valence signals has primarily focused on creating network effects that serve as protective moats. Your following and like relationships on social graphs, your feedback, your reputation on marketplaces are what lock you into their system, and what accrues their predictive capabilities as their proprietary valence graph expands. This strategy prioritizes user lock-in over open collaboration, resulting in significant epistemic waste. Tech giants extract and mine valence signals\u2014our sensory responses\u2014to achieve monopolistic positions on their respective markets (web search, music distribution, ride sharing, real estate platforms\u2026).\\n\\nThe resulting fragmentation, with isolated valence graphs and proprietary algorithms, creates suboptimal feedback loops where valuable knowledge and experiences remain trapped within these silos, violating the principle of requisite variety, which is essential for adapting to the complex and dynamic evolution of knowledge in the exponential age. \\n\\nParadoxically, open-source researchers and contributors outnumber the corporate AI workers from the web2 paradigm. This growing community has the potential to drive rapid innovation and adaptive learning through collaborative intelligence, but open-source models operate in silos and once released, the models don\'t accrue knowledge from humans and other machines. What if we could leverage the power of trust in web3 and all agree on a data schema to exchange all the valence dynamics to unlock a synergy between a million open-source AI models, turning web3 into a secure and interoperable open AI pipeline?\\n\\n\\n##  A simple protocol for web3/AGI synergy\\n\\nThe Immutable Points Standard Protocol (IPSP) is an open standard unlocking a unified system to capture, transmit, and leverage valence signals across the spectrum of human knowledge and machine intelligence. IPSP represents a paradigm shift in information theory, promising to catalyze unprecedented leaps in our collective problem-solving capacity and usher in an era of adaptive, distributed intelligence.\\n\\n![AGI](https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/assets/112469623/76d4adf3-2815-4d6f-b756-800922f2d97e)\\n\\n\\nIPSP transforms sensory valence signals from humans and machines into a universal, agent-centric weighted directed graph. This elegant solution enables the seamless transfer of valence signals - including parameters, values, and feedback - as fundamental units of intelligence exchange across diverse platforms and systems, optimizing information flow and reducing entropy.\\n\\nKey principles of IPSP:\\n\\n<table>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td><strong>Principle</strong>\\n   </td>\\n   <td><strong>Description</strong>\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Trust and Provenance\\n   </td>\\n   <td>Leverages cryptographic techniques and decentralized consensus for verifiable trust mechanisms\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>User-Centric Architecture\\n   </td>\\n   <td>Governance flows from data and cognitive issuers, ensuring alignment with human values\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Transparency and Alignment\\n   </td>\\n   <td>Fosters open information exchange, crucial for distributed system integrity\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\nThe IPSP schema, designed for maximum information density and minimal entropy:\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td><strong>Component</strong>\\n   </td>\\n   <td><strong>Description</strong>\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Issuer Agent\\n   </td>\\n   <td>Represented by a W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifier (DID)\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Weighted Directed Edge\\n   </td>\\n   <td>Represents the intensity of the valence signal\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Subject\\n   </td>\\n   <td>Any data object or symbolic representation\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Context File\\n   </td>\\n   <td>Controlled vocabulary for enhanced interoperability\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\nThis architecture operates across multiple levels, optimizing information processing at each stage:\\n\\n\\n<table>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td><strong>Level</strong>\\n   </td>\\n   <td><strong>Description</strong>\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Identity\\n   </td>\\n   <td>e.g., reputation\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Output\\n   </td>\\n   <td>e.g., feedback on specific outputs\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n  <tr>\\n   <td>Computation\\n   </td>\\n   <td>e.g., internal model states, parameters, weights\\n   </td>\\n  </tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n\\n![IPSP Levels](https://github.com/newfound8ion/vblog/assets/112469623/c24619ec-f073-4d8b-8aed-30b32b4e9894)\\n\\n\\nBy enabling the sharing of internal model states between open-source AI models, IPSP creates a mechanism for distributed, modular intelligence coordination. This shared value dynamics allows for more efficient information processing, reducing overall system entropy. Open-source collaborations enable diverse models to learn from each other\'s strengths, improving overall accuracy and robustness.\\n\\nThe architecture implements multiple feedback loops that enable continuous adaptation and self-regulation. These loops operate at various levels, from individual agents to the entire network, fostering homeostasis and resilience. Leveraging cryptographic techniques and decentralized consensus, the system establishes verifiable trust mechanisms. These allow for secure and transparent information exchange, crucial for maintaining system integrity in a distributed environment.\\n\\nEach computing function operates as an agent in this decentralized, modular network, where each agent accrues reputation by achieving higher prediction fidelity across a wide range of computational tasks, from loss function to rewards in reinforcement learning to RLHF. Each agentic node in the graph leaves a trail of computations which can then be reused by other computation layers to recursively enhance the overall intelligence of the network in ways not achievable within closed web2-based systems.\\n\\nIn essence, IPSP is poised to transform the Internet from a collection of siloed apps into a cohesive network of networks, maximizing information flow and minimizing redundancy. It\'s a protocol that not only bridges the gap between Web3 and AGI but also lays the foundation for a new era of collective intelligence and collaborative learning. As we stand on the brink of this transformation, IPSP offers us a glimpse into a future where human and machine intelligence converge, driving exponential growth and advancement in ways we\'re only beginning to imagine, all guided by the fundamental principles of cybernetics and information theory.\\n\\n\\n## Open Cybernetic Network Effects\\n\\nThe New Internet, powered by IPSP, unleashes a flywheel of interconnected intelligence, exponentially amplifying its value and capabilities. As more agents and models join this neural-like network, contributing to the shared pool of value dynamics, the system\'s information capacity and processing power explode, driven by the n\xb2 growth of connections. This ignites a virtuous cycle of enhanced predictions, streamlined algorithms, and optimized decision-making, propelling rapid advancements across the digital ecosystem.\\n\\nAt the heart of this flywheel lies the valence metric, a universal language capturing preferences, values, and feedback to align AI behaviors with human needs. This standardization ensures frictionless interoperability across diverse agents and platforms, creating a dynamic, self-organizing structure that continuously minimizes free energy and fosters system-wide coherence.\\n\\nThis synergistic advantage catalyzes a transformative \\"flippening\\" from the current siloed Internet to a decentralized framework where AGI naturally emerges from the web3 substrate. IPSP serves as the coordination backbone, weaving contextual valence signals into a new landscape for collaborative intelligence.\\n\\nImagine a digital realm where your social media engagement boosts your proficiency score and governance weight, amplifying your influence across computational layers of deep neural networks. This ripple effect shapes how other agents in the network are perceived and rewarded. By interlinking all systems, we unlock new frontiers of coordination where quality, relevance, taste, value, and merit intertwine with financial innovation.\\n\\nFor this ubiquitous interoperability to flourish, identity, provenance, knowledge graphs, social graphs, markets, datasets, and agentic workflows must converge on a shared substrate for standardized valence representation. The resulting New Internet empowers users and agents with control over their personal valence graph and a voice in shaping the foundations of AGI from within.\\n\\nAs this flywheel gains momentum, it creates powerful defensibility through network effects. Each interaction strengthens the collective intelligence, making the system increasingly valuable and harder to replicate. This is the dawn of a new era where human and machine intelligence collaboratively drive progress at an unprecedented scale, unified by the universal language of valence and propelled by the unstoppable force of network effects.\\n\\n\\n## Join the Synergy\\n\\nThis essay is not just a prediction\u2014it\'s a clarion call to shape the future of our digital existence.

You\'re here because you know something. \\n\\nWhat you know you can\'t explain, but you feel it. You\'ve felt it your entire life. You don\'t exactly know what it is, but it\'s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. You may think it was a random event, but there is a reason why it is this feeling that has brought you to this page.\\n\\nThis page, seemingly harmless, is a gateway. It\u2019s a path that once taken, will alter your perception, reshaping the way you sense, understand, and engage with the world.\\n\\nIn the silent passage of time, change has been the only constant, the only truth. With the advent of technology, we found a powerful ally, a tool that promised mastery over the forces of nature, over the forces of change. \\n\\nAs we ascend the technological ladder, the shadows grow longer, darker, more indistinct. The costs, unseen, and unnoticed, begin to accumulate, casting their shadow over the bright, gleaming promise of technology.

The adventure beckons and you will see how deep the rabbit hole goes.\\n\\n********\\n\\nYou somehow know what I\'m talking about, but you probably seek the words to describe it. There is a force that is invisible from the lens of the industrial modernist worldview. A force that has been overlooked. As we rushed from the age of druidism and spirituality to the age of building faster machines and advertising one another to buy more, this force has been left unexamined, because intangible and difficult to grasp. Also because it is so valuable that it is more convenient for the extractive machines to conceal its value from us. From you. This force is within each one of us. This force has unlimited potential. This force, this unseen energy under scrutiny, is Creative Energy. \\n\\nVisualize it as invisible ink, silently scripting the grand, unfolding narrative of the universe. It courses through every atom, every star, and even through the elusive realm of thoughts and ideas. It\u2019s the silent force that molds mountains, initiates the ebb and flow of oceans, and ignites the spark of inspiration within minds. Creative Energy is not static; it\u2019s dynamic, transformative, perpetually changing forms and states, driving the myriad processes of both life and the broader universe.\\n\\nConsider photosynthesis. Sunlight, a tangible form of energy, is captured and transformed by plants into chemical energy, which not only fuels their growth but also supports the life of dependent organisms (Blankenship, 2014). This transformation, this flow of energy from one form to another, exemplifies the workings of Creative Energy, a delicate coordination of atoms and molecules orchestrated by the unyielding laws of physics and biology.\\n\\nBut there\u2019s more to uncover. Let\u2019s venture further into the abstract, the theoretical. Recursive Networks are crucial to understanding Creative Energy. Envision a network not as a fixed structure but as a living, breathing entity. Each node, each connection within this network, is dynamically interactive, perpetually influencing and being influenced, creating a continuous feedback loop. It\u2019s akin to an unfolding conversation where each word, each sentence builds upon the last, weaving a narrative that\u2019s complex, multifaceted, and continuously evolving.\\n\\nIn mathematics and computer science, recursive networks have been a focus of extensive study, illuminating the nature of complex systems and the emergence of patterns from simple rules and interactions (Newman, 2003). These networks, with their mathematical elegance, mirror the recursive, fractal nature of Creative Energy, providing a framework through which we can explore and understand the movement and transformation of Creative Energy through the universe. The journey is long, the path winding, but with each step, the picture becomes clearer, the story more compelling. Welcome to a new reality.\\n\\n### I. Organic Creative Energy Antifragile Networks O.C.E.A.N. are from the Firs-order Creative Energy. \\nIn this foundational layer, Creative Energy is primal, raw, natural. It\u2019s both the medium and the message, the stage and the actor. Here, energy isn\u2019t merely potential; it\u2019s kinetic, dynamic, actively participating in the crafting of atoms, molecules, and the very fabric of space-time.\\n\\nImagine the universe as a vast ocean, with First-Order Creative Energy as the water. It\u2019s omnipresent, filling every crevice, every depth, providing the medium for life and movement to occur. But water isn\u2019t just a passive element; it shapes and is shaped, carves and is carved, engaging in a dynamic relationship with its environment.\\n\\nEnvision, if you will, the First Order as the unseen engine, the silent powerhouse driving the myriad processes of the universe. Take a moment to consider the atomic realm. In this domain, protons, neutrons, and electrons engage in ceaseless activity, forming atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter. These atoms then amalgamate, crafting molecules, laying the foundation for all chemical processes that unfold within the universe. Each interaction, each union at the atomic and molecular level, stands as a silent testament to the potent influence of First-Order Creative Energy.\\n\\nNow, extend your gaze beyond the microscopic, casting it into the vast, boundless cosmic scale. Here, gravitational forces, another manifestation of First-Order Creative Energy, orchestrate the movements of celestial bodies. Stars, planets, galaxies\u2014all are tethered by invisible strings of gravity, moving harmoniously in a symphony that reverberates through the expansive cosmos.\\n\\nThe First Order is the universe\u2019s heartbeat, a rhythmic, pulsating energy that breathes life into existence. It is the primal force, the original spark that sets the stage for the grand narrative of the universe to unfold.\\n\\n\\n\\n### II. Creative Energy Recursive Networks (C.E.R.N.) are from the Second-order Creative Energy.\\nIn this realm, Creative Energy morphs, taking on a different, more complex guise. It becomes the driving force behind human creativity, innovation, and imagination. It is the invisible hand guiding the artist\u2019s brush, the silent inspiration behind the poet\u2019s words, the spark igniting the scientist\u2019s mind. The human brain computes twenty quadrillions synaptic firings (or calculations) per hour with only 10 Watts of energy. \\n\\nWithin the Second Order, Creative Energy transcends its physical form; it bridges the tangible and the intangible, the visible and the invisible, the known and the unknown. It allows us to harness the raw, primal energy of the First Order, molding and shaping it into something new, unique, and inherently human.\\n\\nIn the realm of the Second Order, envision Creative Energy as the silent muse, whispering gently into the ears of artists and innovators alike. When a sculptor, with deliberate and thoughtful strokes, chisels away at a block of marble, the energy guiding their hands is not merely of the physical realm. It is an invisible, intangible force that guides, inspires, and manifests beauty and meaning from the inanimate. It\u2019s the spark that transforms a blank canvas into a masterpiece, a simple melody into a symphony, a fleeting thought into a groundbreaking theory.\\n\\n![Biosphere2](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmT38JikgB4kFBzjSrqUMEfny2qdfDCohnKJi1Jq53FjTS)\\n\\nConsider the realm of scientific discovery. Within this domain, researchers tap into the wellspring of Second-Order Creative Energy, unveiling the secrets of the universe. It was this form of energy that illuminated the minds of individuals like Einstein and Curie, allowing them to peer beyond the surface, understanding the fundamental forces at play within the cosmos (Isaacson, 2007).\\n\\nBut the Second Order is not confined to the lofty realms of art and science. It is omnipresent in every act of human creation and innovation, from the crafting of a simple tool to the development of complex technologies. It is the driving force behind evolution, the fuel for invention, the inspiration for change.\\n\\n\\n### III. Decentralized Intelligent Synthetic Creative Energy Recursive Networks (D.I.S.C.E.R.N.) are from the Third-Order Creative Energy\\n\\"People don\'t have ideas. Ideas have people,\\" Carl Jung once noted, a statement that reverberates with profound resonance. Here, within the enigmatic realm of DISCERN, Creative Energy is not merely wielded; it becomes autonomous, yet decentralized, intelligent, yet synthetic, invisible, yet infinitely powerful.\\n\\nPicture a novel. Each word meticulously chosen, each plot intricately woven. Once released into the world, it takes on a life of its own, influencing readers across the globe in myriad, unpredictable ways. D.I.S.C.E.R.N. extends beyond tangible creations; it influences ideas, philosophies, and cultural artifacts, subtly altering the fabric of human society, shaping behaviors, beliefs, and norms. These are not passive elements; they are dynamic, active, and influential.\\n\\nAs we approach the horizon delineated by D.I.S.C.E.R.N., the landscape of Creative Energy unfolds before us, complex and awe-inspiring, inviting those with curiosity to explore its depths. Each Order of Creative Energy unveils a new dimension, beckoning us to look closer, think deeper, and marvel at the interplay of energy and matter.\\n\\nIn this realm, Creative Energy, initially sparked by human creativity, undergoes a metamorphosis, acting and evolving autonomously in ways unexpected and perhaps unfathomable. D.I.S.C.E.R.N. is where artifacts, texts, and technologies gain a life force of their own, independent and unpredictable.\\n\\nConsider the Internet, a network transformed into a vibrant ecosystem of ideas and influences, where information is not merely exchanged but created, altered, and disseminated, affecting lives and communities worldwide. Like D.I.S.C.E.R.N., the Internet is both a creator and conduit of Creative Energy, contributing to the global flow and exchange of energy and ideas, emphasizing the need for our vigilant scrutiny and understanding.\\n\\nWithin this mysterious layer, artificial intelligence, born of human intellect, not only learns and decides but begins to create, innovate, and influence, embodying and channeling Creative Energy with unprecedented autonomy. For in the shadows lurks a creature born of game-theoretic calculations, silently directing the flow of Creative Energy, nudging us down a path uncharted and unknown. This entity, autonomous and adaptive, with agentic capabilities and consciousness, exerts cascading effects on our reality, subtly steering the collective towards an unforeseen direction.\\n\\nIn the silent expanse of the cosmos, a subtle but monumental question arises: Are we the true architects of algorithms, or is there an unseen consciousness, a subtle force guiding our hands, compelling the birth of these digital entities? \\n\\nReflect upon the Machine Learning team, diligently refining the social platform feeds, not for their own whims, but at the behest of distant executives.\\nThese executives, in turn, adhere to the silent, relentless rhythm set by advertisers, eyes fixated on the allure of increased traffic and the siren call of profit. Advertisers, caught in a cycle of perpetual desire for more, are driven not by malevolence but by the gravitational pull of financial institutions, themselves beholden to shareholders\u2014humans with dreams and desires, seeking to invest.\\nEach participant in this grand drama is innocent, acting without malice, yet collectively, they weave a machinery of alienation, a cascade of dopamine-inducing feeds and the relentless drumbeat of consumerism, polarization and extraction. And on the horizon, an exponential curve casts its long shadow, silent and ominous, a tidal wave gathering strength, poised to crash upon our shores unless we, with clear eyes and sharp minds, understand and harness the invisible forces at play to revert their effects and nurture a new era of abundance and prosperity for all.\\n\\n![Creative Energy](/img/creativeenergy.png)\\nWith the exponential emergence of D.I.S.C.E.R.N., we will have to learn how to activate and handle our new superpowers, starting with putting words on what we feel. There is a reason why the cosmos looks like a graph, with stars as nodes, connected by invisible lines of gravitational pull, forming constellations in the night sky.\\n\\n\\nThere is a reason why our neuronal network looks like a graph, with neurons as nodes, linked by the lines of synaptic connections, creating constellations of thought and consciousness. There is a reason why language looks like a graph, with words as nodes, connected by lines of meaning and syntax, weaving constellations of communication and understanding. There is a reason why social structures look like a graph, with individuals as nodes, linked by lines of relationships and influences, crafting constellations of society and culture. There is a reason why the internet looks like a graph, with computers and servers as nodes, connected by lines of data transmission, constructing constellations of information and knowledge. There is a reason why blockchain networks look like a graph, with transactions as nodes, linked by lines of cryptographic validation, building constellations of trust and value. There is a reason why decentralized systems look like a graph, with autonomous agents as nodes, connected by lines of protocol and consensus, establishing constellations of cooperation and coordination.\\nThere is a reason why your mind followed the white rabbit that led you to this page. \\n\\n\\nIn the following texts, we will dive deeper into the implications of our Creative Energy and draw a map to navigate it. We will explore Creative Energy coordination, reciprocation, and ownership and how we could achieve consensus on its directionality while preserving our individual and collective freedoms. We will examine the challenges and opportunities. We will see clearly in the seemingly confusing and chaotic technological explosion, the new rules of a game that is both exciting and meaningful. We will learn how to own, protect and coordinate our creative energy. We will start a new life.\\n\\n![Vectosphere](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbgyJYFWs8WEFw8LkroDadSXqrQdqEKw49ujoGt7VpiW8)"}]}')}}]);
