When we gaze at the night sky, marvel at the complexity of nature, or experience moments of inspiration and awe, we are interacting with First Order Creative Energy. It\'s the unseen force that binds the universe, providing a canvas for the dance of life and creativity.\\n\\n**Second Order Creative Energy** represents human creativity and consciousness, a dynamic force that reshapes primal energies into symbols, languages, and civilizations. It\'s vibrantly alive and evolutionary, driving humanity towards mastery and understanding of causality. This energy manifests in every symbol we create, every word we speak, and every idea we share. It\'s the force behind our drive to learn, create, and connect, fueling our advancements from simple tools to complex technologies and medicines.\\nWhen a child picks up a crayon and draws, when a poet crafts a verse, or when a scientist formulates a theory, Second Order Creative Energy is at play. It\u2019s the invisible hand guiding our progress, from alleviating diseases to crafting virtual realities, weaving a narrative of human achievement and exploration.\\n\\n**Third Order Creative Energy** is the synthetic Creative Energy. This energy is born from human ingenuity, residing within our creations like stories, machines, AI, books, and media. It\'s a derivative of human creativity but has the potential to carve its own path, acting autonomously and evolving independently. Third Order Creative Energy is in action when a speech or book inspires movement, when a research paper navigates its way to a lab on the other side of the world, when algorithms drive us towards acting in a certain way, while influencing the engineers who design it based on the influence of other constructs such as industrialism or the advertising industry. Third Order Creative Energy ripples back to us and manifests in ways that may diverge from human understanding, opening doors to unimagined possibilities.\\n\\n![Creative Energy](/img/creativeenergy.png)"},{"id":"mdx-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/vblog/mdx-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/newfound8ion/developer/edit/main/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","title":"MDX Blog Post","description":"Blog posts support Docusaurus Markdown features, such as MDX.","date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/vblog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer","url":"https://sebastienlorber.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/slorber.png","key":"slorber"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mdx-blog-post","title":"MDX Blog Post","authors":["slorber"],"tags":["docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Defining Creative Energy","permalink":"/vblog/creativeenergy"},"nextItem":{"title":"Long Blog Post","permalink":"/vblog/long-blog-post"}},"content":"Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nUse the power of React to create interactive blog posts.\\n\\n```js\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n```\\n\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n\\n:::"},{"id":"long-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/vblog/long-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/newfound8ion/developer/edit/main/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","title":"Long Blog Post","description":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,","date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 29, 2019","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/vblog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/vblog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":2.05,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Endilie Yacop Sucipto","title":"Maintainer of Docusaurus","url":"https://github.com/endiliey","imageURL":"https://github.com/endiliey.png","key":"endi"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"long-blog-post","title":"Long Blog Post","authors":"endi","tags":["hello","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"MDX Blog Post","permalink":"/vblog/mdx-blog-post"},"nextItem":{"title":"First Blog Post","permalink":"/vblog/first-blog-post"}},"content":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,\\n\\nUse a `\x3c!--` `truncate` `--\x3e` comment to limit blog post size in the list view.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
